   <p>I’m a yellow-haired female who likes waffles and news. Well, there's a lot of people that don't consider salad a food. You know what? America is awesome. It's so full of hope. And small towns and big cities. And real people and delicious beverages. Ain’t no party like a Leslie Knope party cause a Leslie Knope party is 30 parties.</p>
   
   <p>Math is worthless in real life. Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food? Positive is always better than negative. Barack Obama said, “Yes we can,” and now he’s president.</p>
   
   <p>I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns. I took your idea and I made it better. It was a pizza stuffed with little pizzas. And the crusts of those little pizzas were stuffed with chocolate.</p>
   
   <p>So, I just slept seven hours, which is twice as long as I usually sleep. I wonder who else was born in Eagleton... Voldemort probably. How ever many waffles it takes to keep you in business. I'm gonna get drunk and then I'm gonna order a three course meal where each course is made of dessert.</p>
